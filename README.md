# Milestone 2 - Kids Days Out Website

I am designing a website designed to provide parents with ideas for days out in the Hertfordshire region. The website is designed to provide a quick list of top places to visit, for those wanting some ideas straight away, along with a more thorough list, which is searchable using filters, for those wanting to explore the various options available.  

## UX

*Overview*

The website is aimed to cater for parents of children, who are looking for ideas on days out to keep their kids entertained. The goal is to provide ideas to these parents. It is an informational website only, so the website provides high level information on the locations.

*User Stories*

Parents:
* I want to be able to see some popular locations to visit.
* I want to be able to explore the locations using filters to personalise my search.
* I want to see where these locations are on a map, to see how far they are.
* I want links to the websites of the actual locations if I need more information, or I need to book tickets etc.

Website Owner:
* I want a contact form for people to be able to get in touch – this may be the users (parents) who have a query, or it may be business owners who may want their business to feature on the website.

*5 S's*

**Strategy**

The primary goal is to meet the user objectives, which is to provide information on suitable days out, in a user-friendly and intuitive way. The website will be designed to be quick to scroll through, as the users (busy parents) will most likely want to be able to scan through the site quickly.

**Scope**

The overall look and feel of the website was influenced by researching websites of similar websites:

* These generally are simplistic in design.
* The content on the websites is fairly minimal.
* There are no complicated features used on these websites, they are simple to use and navigate through.
* There is a simple colour scheme used, with 2 or 3 colours used, and plenty of white space.
* There is an interactive map, where you can see the locations plotted out.
* The places are displayed in a list format, but in a visually appealing way, with images and some brief text, also the list items include website links to the business/location being referenced.

With this in mind, my website will include:

* Some introductory info explaining the website.
* A “top 5” of the more popular places to visit.
* A searchable database where you can search for and filter results on an interactive map.
* A contact form for the ability to submit queries to the website owner.

In addition:
* The website will be simplistic in design in line with my current capabilities, and similar to other websites I've seen designed for this purpose.
* The website will be designed using a mobile first approach, it is likely the target demographic (busy parents, who browse the web quickly using the phone) will want to view the website on mobile devices.

**Structure**

In line with my research from other similar websites, and based on the goals identified in the strategy section, the website will be structured as follows:

1. Home page: 
   * This will provide a basic introduction to the website so users immediately know what to expect, a background image will also be used to further reinforce the purpose of the site, and make the site more visually appealing.

2. Top 5 Places:
   * There will be a section displaying a top 5 list, this will serve those wanting some immediate inspiration for ideas on days out, who may not wish to scroll through the whole site.
   * The locations will be displayed in a “card” format, for clean and responsive presentation.
   * The cards will include an image of the location, a website link, and some high-level info about the location, to provide the user with a snapshot of the location.
   
3. Map:
   * There will be an interactive map to display locations of days out, there will be buttons to filter by indoor and outdoor locations, for ease of use.

4. Contact:
   * This is included as the last page, as contact pages are generally the last page or section on a website. Here there will be a form to enable people to contact the website owner. 

5. Header:
   * The header will contain the club logo on the left-hand side, which will be an active link back to the home page for ease of use.
   * The right-hand side will contain links to the other pages in the site, for ease of use.
   * The header will remain fixed to the top of the page, to give familiarity to the user, and provide them with a quick way to navigate to any of the other pages.

6. Footer:  
   * The footer will contain links to other social media accounts, this is placed at the end as the user may want to explore the websites social media accounts, after absorbing the content of the website. 

**Skeleton**

include link to wireframes!!!

**Surface**

*Colours/Fonts*

The colours used on the site will be blue/green, and white:
* Blue/green will be used following research which suggested this invoked feelings of trust, and peacefulness, appropriate for this type of informational website.
* White space will be used to keep the presentation of the site clean.

The fonts used will be Quicksand and Open Sans from Google Fonts: 
* I wanted a font combination which was clear to read, and gave a family friendly, yet professional feel, given the purpose of the site.
* After exploring various options in google fonts, I decided on this combination.
* It is described as “modern, casual, yet elegant web safe font”, and “strong, stable, and defined” on the website below, which influenced my decision.

*Responsiveness*

For smaller displays, the menu will change to a burger bar, for ease of use.
Some sections will scroll from top-to-bottom instead of left-to-right for better presentation on mobile devices:
1. The Top 5 section
2. The interactive map section
